# Documents

The Documents service allows for uploading loan-related documents needed to service the loan. This allows for integration with third-party document retention systems to comply with document-retention requirements. 

<aside class="warning">The Documents service and POST https://api.nelnet.io/documentapi/documents/upload/ endpoint are set to be deprecated in favor of the Document Manager service and its endpoints. See the Document Manager section for more information about this service.</aside>

# Onboarding Version 2

The Onboarding Version 2 service supports real-time loading of loans, income share agreements, borrwers, and participants onto the Velocity Servicing system. Onboarding Version 2 makes it easier to add loans/agreements with multiple borrowers/participants per loan/agreement. This version also supports more complex loan and agreement types, including education and consumer loans/agreeements, multiple periods, and multiple disbursements.

<aside class="notice">Onboarding Version 2 is preferred going forward, but both versions are currently supported.</aside>

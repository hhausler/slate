# Onboarding

The Onboarding service supports real-time loading of loans and their borrowers onto the Velocity Servicing system. The service enables lenders to review the onboarding status by individual onboarding ID or by onboarding bundle (a collection of onboarded loans). Onboarding provides the ability to reconcile successful, partial and failed onboarding actions.

<aside class="notice">Onboarding Version 2 is the preferred service going forward, but both versions are currently supported.</aside>
